I am currently a Staff Data Scientist at Walmart Connect, where I was the first data scientist hired on the Advertising Sales team. My work focuses on bridging the gap between complex data infrastructure and executive decision-making. I build and maintain models for sales revenue forecasting, sales quota/incentive planning, advertiser churn prediction, and the complex data pipelines that power the dashboards used by hundreds of unique daily active business users.

Prior to working at Walmart Connect, I worked for four years at Callisto Media Inc., a data-driven book publishing start-up, where I maintained the topic demand model at the core of the business up until its sale to Penguin Random House in May 2023. Before Callisto, I was a PhD Student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I conducted research on political misinformation, religious prejudice, political contributor networks, and "small world" network structures.

I have spent the majority of my career working on small teams of data scientists, which has made me a data science generalist. I have practical experience working directly with business executives and leading projects with both business stakeholders and technical contributors from multiple teams, as well as technical experience in time series forecasting, supervised machine learning, A/B testing, observational causal inference, and database design and architecture.

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, watching Ohio State football, camping and hiking with my wife, Samantha, and my one-year-old (as of February 2026) daughter, Violet, around where we live in Southern California.
